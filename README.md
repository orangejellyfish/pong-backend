# pong-backend

A serverless backend for a multiplayer version of pong built for a talk at [HalfStack On the Shore(ditch) 2022][hs] using Websockets, long-running lambdas (for game loops), and a heap of other tech. For the front-end project go to [this repo][pf]

Originally scaffolded using the opinionated starter kit by [orangejellyfish][oj] for
[Serverless framework][sls]

Note: This is a rough and ready demo - do not copy and paste this and expect production quality code!
